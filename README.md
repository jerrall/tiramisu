# Tiramisu Savings Club

(This is a starter for the Tirasimu Savings Club project. Initial code taken from Nader Dabit's tutorial - see below for URL)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## Onboarding your developer environment

If you want to use nvm

nvm use 14
```

### Install node modules

```

## Open Visual Studio Code
