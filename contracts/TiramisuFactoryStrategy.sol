                - If owed balance = 0, this address is settled
                - If owed balance < 0, this address actually owes the protocol $ and is currently a liability to other users
                - If owed balance > 0, the protocol owes this user
            Allocate remaining funds to addresses where owed balance > 0, weighted by how much is owed to them

            This formula works because a savings group is in theory a closed system, with no expectation of profit
            Ideally, the amount of $ you deposited, is the exact same amount you should get back at the end
            If that's not true, then something went wrong.
